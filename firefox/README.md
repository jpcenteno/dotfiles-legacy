# Firefox preferences

## What is a `user.js` file?

The `user.js` file is a dotfile that sets `about:config` options at startup
time.

From the [Ghaks-user.js
Wiki](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/1.1-Overview)
> A user.js, which resides in the root directory of a profile, is used to set
> preferences for that profile when Firefox starts. Preferences are settings
> that control Firefox's behavior. Some can be set from the Options interface
> and all can be found in about:config, except for what are called hidden
> preferences which will only show when they are set by the user.
