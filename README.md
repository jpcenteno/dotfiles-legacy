# Jpcenteno's Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration scripts and dotfiles for
workstation machines.

The configuration script is provided as an [Ansible][1] playbook, thus
requiring [Python][2] to be present, which is a safe asumption for personal
computers.

## Usage

```sh
ansible-playbook workstation.yml
```
